# Diabetes Prediction System

## Overview
This repository contains the source code for a Diabetes Prediction System. The system is designed to predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes based on significant features including age, BMI, insulin, and glucose level. It utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze input data and provide predictions. In this application use SVM and Logistic Regression models for prediction and in training time gets the accuracy of those two models and the web application uses the most accurate one for prediction. 

## Features
- **Prediction Model**: Implements a machine learning model trained on a dataset containing historical data of individuals with and without diabetes.
- **Web Interface**: Provides a user-friendly web interface for users to input their information and receive predictions.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes modules for data cleaning, feature engineering, and normalization to prepare the input data for the prediction model.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates the performance of the prediction model using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for development.
- **Scikit-learn**: Utilized for implementing machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
- **Flask**: Used to develop the web interface.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Frontend technologies for the web interface.
- **Pandas, NumPy**: Libraries used for data manipulation and preprocessing.

## Installation
